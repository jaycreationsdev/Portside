# Portside
A large scale custom map for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. With Over 100,000 unique downloads, and over one million views, this is definitely one of my most successful projects ever. It was also a project that I worked with a lot of people on, and as I was only 16 years old when I made the map, it was invaluable experience to working on remote teams.
