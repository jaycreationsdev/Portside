# Portside
A large scale custom map for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. With Over 100,000 unique downloads, and over one million views, this is definitely one of my most successful projects ever. It was also a project that I worked with a lot of people on, and as I was only 16 years old when I made the map, it was invaluable experience to working on remote teams. This map was made for the extremely popular mode "Zombies" and was one of my favorite projects.

Tools used:
Black Ops 3 Radiant, Blender, Microsoft Visual Studio
